## Welcome to PBR!

Welcome to the home of **Psi Beta Rho** (a.k.a. **PBR** or **ψβρ**), UCLA's competetive cybersecurity team! We are a group of hackers, programmers, and security enthusiasts who love to learn and compete. We are a part of [ACM Cyber at UCLA](https://acmcyber.com/) and are advised by [Dr. Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info/)! Whether we are pwning a binary or attacking a site using cross-site scripting, we like to have fun! If you want to see who is on our team, check out our [team page](/team). To see some of our writeups, check out our [blog](/blog). If you are interested in seeing what we usually talk about, check out our [past practices](/past)! If you want to see what CTFs we have attended in the past, check out our [CTFs page](/ctfs).

## What do we do?
We compete in **CTFs** or [Capture the Flag](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) events, where we solve cybersecurity challenges to earn points! Currently, we meet weekly for our practices where we learn about a new topic and solve challenges related to web exploitation, cryptography, binary exploitation, and reverse engineering in addition to regularly competing in CTFs every other weekend. We also regularly invite notable speakers from top CTF teams or industry to hear about their experiences and learn about how to improve our skills to work in research and industry! Additinonally, we work on projects and research related to security including hosting our own CTF annually, [LA CTF](https://lactf.uclaacm.com/)!

## Join Us
Interested in joining PBR or just want to check us out? We have weekly practices this quarter in **Ackerman Union 3517** on **Tuesdays** from **6:00 PM to 8:00 PM**. These are always open to the public so be sure to swing by! The best way to stay up to date with notifications for our team is to join the [ACM Cyber Discord](https://discord.gg/j9dgf2q) where we send out notifications for practices, upcoming CTFs, and like to hang out and talk about CTFs and cybersecurity. Whether you are an **experienced** CTF player or a complete **beginner**, we would love to have you on our team! We are always looking for new members so if you are a UCLA student interested in joining us, please contact us for the application! **No experience necessary!**
