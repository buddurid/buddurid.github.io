Welcome to the home for Psi Beta Rho, UCLA's competitive Capture the Flag (CTF) cybersecurity team! We are a group of hackers, programmers, and security enthusiasts who love to learn and compete. Whether we are pwning a binary or attacking a site using cross-site scripting, we like to have fun!

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). For more information on how to run this site locally, check out the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section.

## Getting Started
1. To get a local copy of this project, first clone the repository and change into the directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/pbrucla/pbrucla.github.io.git
cd pbrucla.github.io
```
2. Install all _Prerequisites_ and follow the _Instructions_ at [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
3. To build the site and make it available on a local server, run ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` and check out [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

## Contributing
1. Before making any changes, run `git pull` to ensure your local repository is up to date.
2. Make a new branch for your changes. `main` is a protected branch, **so you cannot push to it**.
```
git checkout -b firstName/feature
```
3. Coding time!
4. Once you're ready, stage and commit your changes:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push
```
5. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/pbrucla/pbrucla.github.io/pulls) with your changes, and let a project lead know.
6. If your code passes code review, then we can merge it into `main`. Congratulations! If you'd like, it's now safe to delete your branch.
